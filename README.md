2SAT Solver vs. DumbSAT Solver

Andrew Borgie (aborgie)

This repository contains the code of a 2SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm and the DumbSat solver using the brute force method.
Both of these approaches to the SAT problem are compared via their execution times over the course of larger and larger problems. The graph
images produced using the code provide a visualization of how much more efficient the 2SAT solver is. ( O(n) vs (O2^n).
